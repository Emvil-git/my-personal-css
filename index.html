                        I am an Artist, Software Engineering Student, and Aspiring Philosopher and Strongman. I play these parts with a burning passion and the strongest of wills. I am enjoying the ever-arduous adventure that is life, immersing in its every joy and misery, every glory and pain. I am grateful for every torturous struggle for they allow me to be strong, may you find euphoria in yours.</p>

                    <p class="skill-definition">The curse of the creative is that, for its mind, creation is an act as involuntary, maybe even as necessary, as breathing.
                        <br><br>
                        When this act of creating is not directed, it will direct itself and create something.
